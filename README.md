## Film Query Project

# what is this project about:
### The purpose of this project is to illustrate how SQL can be used in combination with Java to collect desired data from a table on a server.

## How it works:
* Choose how you would like to find a movie on the film database by selecting either 1 to search by the film id, or 2 to search by a keyword(title or film description).
* After selecting one of the options above choose either and id number, if you chose option 1, or enter a keyword, if you chose option 2.
* The menu will continue to appear until you choose option 3, "Exit". Once selected, you will receive a exit message and the program will terminate.

# What I've learned:
### I have learned how to access a database on a server using SQL together with Java classes and methods.
