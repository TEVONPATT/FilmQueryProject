## Film Query Project

# What this project is about
### The purpose of this project is to illustrate how SQL can be used in combination with Java to collect desired data from a table on a server.

### [How it works]
1. A menu will appear once the program runs with 3 options on it: 1) search for a film by the film id, 2) search for a film by keyword, and 3) exit the program.
2. Select the option you want. (The keyword search will match the text you enter to the text in a film's title or description).
2. After selecting one of the options above, choose an id number, if you chose option 1, or enter a keyword, if you chose option 2.
3. The menu will continue to appear until you choose option 3, "Exit". Once selected, you will receive an exit message and the program will terminate.

## What I've learned:
I have learned how to access a database on a server using SQL together with Java classes and methods.
